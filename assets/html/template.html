        <p>And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. A lot of things can
          change in twelve years, Admiral. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. I am
          your
          worst nightmare! I'll be sure to note that in my log. Ensign Babyface! Then maybe you should consider this: if
          anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate
          surprise
          parties. I would *never* do that to you. Your head is not an artifact! Did you come here for something in particular
          or just general Riker-bashing?</p>
        <p>Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Congratulations - you just destroyed the
          Enterprise. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. The
          Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant
          melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. We have a saboteur aboard. I'll alert the crew. Well, I'll
          say this for him - he's sure of himself. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. That might've
          been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. This is not about revenge. This is about justice.
          Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data?</p>
        <p>Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." Fear
          is the true enemy, the only enemy. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? and attack the Romulans. Maybe if we felt any
          human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Now we know what
          they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others.
          Well, that's certainly good to know. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh.</p>
        <p>Besides, you look good in a dress. I
          will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die
          with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You
          used
          to have it for me. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders.
          Or
          do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to
          the ship. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. Maybe we better
          talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear
          gets
          you. We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. I
          think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Computer, belay that order. Why don't we just give
          everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? Fate protects fools, little children and ships named
          Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. Your shields were failing, sir.</p>
