## The path less taken
There are three main path references.
1. All "client code" URLs are based on Vite's `root`, with `base` appended. These include...

Normally, since Eleventy and Nunjucks happen before Vite, their import paths use
the underlying filesystem. However, with `vite-plugin-eleventy`:
> This plugin overrides Eleventy's input and output directories with Vite's root directory configuration. If you want to change where files live, you need to change Vite's root. This also means your 11ty template and include directories are relative to the Vite root. This also means you need to not rely on Vite plugins to set your project root. Further testing will determine if this changes in the future.

tl;dr: With `vite-plugin-eleventy`, `_includes` is relative to Vite's root, not Eleventy's.

## Templating
Nunjucks, alone, gives us runtime templating (I guess). Incorporating Eleventy
into the build takes the Nunjucks templates and generates static markup.

## To-do

* Improve Vite config so that `elements` can serve as root and, therefore, not
    be necessary in the served URL.
* Set Vite's `base` using dev/prod environment configuration from files
    (see https://stackoverflow.com/a/69041080/356016 and https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html)
* Fix types in `libs/qgiv/qgiv.ts` and remove from tsconfig's `exclude`.
* Replace `spacetime` with something better documented.
* License "[Tin Pan Alley JNL](https://www.fontspring.com/fonts/jeff-levine/tin-pan-alley-jnl)" font or find suitable, free replacement
