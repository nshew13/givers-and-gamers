# Tech notes
Originally, this project used Eleventy and Nunjucks in combination with Vite.

[Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/) (or 11ty) is a static site generator,
which uses one or more independent template engines. For this, I chose
[Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html). Together, these
allow me to, for example, reuse a common header or common block of imports
across multiple, otherwise-static "HTML" files. [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is
front-end tooling with some very smart URL and path rewriting.

While I really enjoyed all three, they didn't fit together well. I
couldn't find a reliable, automated way to make the two-step process into one.
In practical terms, I had a stubborn `src` directory (the temporary location for
the Eleventy output to be picked up by Vite) in my output that I hated.

After several attempts, I abandoned these three for [Astro](https://astro.build/),
which, so far, has covered all of my use cases. As bonuses, it feels more
cohesive and the syntax is more React- and JSX-like. The true magic is that it
has worked with ***ZERO*** configuration on my part. Just compare this
document before and after I merged in the port to Astro.

## Dev server
URLs will be of the form `http://localhost:3000/`.

# To-do
* Define a loose Prettier config
* Exclude config.json file from bundling for easier swapping
* Why does `about.<hash>.css` get included in other pages? And is it "about" because it's alphabetically first?

# Tools Used

[softr.io](https://www.softr.io/tools/svg-wave-generator) used to generate the `clip-path` for the main background.

# Things that didn't work

## Animating the SVG drips with keyframes
I attempted to control how the drips receded, but browser support was non-existent.
```
.shrink {
    .drips {
        transition: inherit;
        animation: 15s dripsShrink reverse;
        height: 0;
    }
}

@keyframes dripsShrink {
