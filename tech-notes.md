# Tech notes
Originally, this project used Eleventy and Nunjucks in combination with Vite.

[Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/) (or 11ty) is a static site generator,
which uses one or more independent template engines. For this, I chose
[Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html). Together, these
allow me to, for example, reuse a common header or common block of imports
across multiple, otherwise-static "HTML" files. [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is
front-end tooling with some very smart URL and path rewriting.

While I really enjoyed all three, they didn't fit together well. I
couldn't find a reliable, automated way to make the two-step process into one.
In practical terms, I had a stubborn `src` directory (the temporary location for
the Eleventy output to be picked up by Vite) in my output that I hated.

After several attempts, I abandoned these three for [Astro](https://astro.build/),
which, so far, has covered all of my use cases. As bonuses, it feels more
cohesive and the syntax is more React- and JSX-like. The true magic is that it
has worked with ***ZERO*** configuration on my part. Just compare this
document before and after I merged in the port to Astro.

## Dev server
URLs will be of the form `http://localhost:3000/`.
