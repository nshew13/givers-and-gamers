## Divergent paths
There are three main path bases.
1. Eleventy and Nunjucks shortcode (e.g., `{% extends ... %}`) happen before
   Vite. Their import paths are relative to Eleventy's `dir.input`.
1. All "client code" URLs are based on Vite's `root`, with `base` appended.
   These include image assets (as `src` or `url()`), script `src` and page links.
   Vite rewrites these, as necessary, in the output for `dist`
   * By default `/public` becomes `/`, and Vite prefers you use the shorter notation.
1. TypeScript `import`s work, but VS Code complains about `ts(2307)`. The imports
   ultimately work and `tsc` gives no errors.

**TODO:** I have configured VSC to use the projects `tsc`. I may need a type
definition file. Otherwise, I'll have to do more digging to fix this annoyance.

## Templating
We generate our build in two steps. First, Eleventy takes the Nunjucks files and
generates the HTML. These are output to the `src` directory. Additional HTML,
JavaScript, TypeScript and Sass files are brought along.

Vite takes over from there to import files and adjust URL paths. Output is to
`dist`.

### What's the difference?
My best guess is that Nunjucks, alone, gives us runtime templating. Incorporating
Eleventy into the build takes the Nunjucks templates and generates static markup.

## Running Eleventy with Vite
The `&` "run in parallel" operator for npm scripts _does not work_ on Windows.
`npm-run-all` provides a cross-platform solution in its shorthand runners
for running in sequence (`run-s`) and parallel (`run-p`).

Using these tools (as well as `del-cli` and `delete-empty`), we can easily
script running Eleventy and Vite together. The solution is based on
[this article](https://snugug.com/musings/eleventy-plus-vite/) by Sam Richard,
a.k.a., Snugug.

### Package version
When adding these tools, my package version of `"2022"` started throwing
```
ERROR: Invalid version: "2022"
```
Even `"2.2"` didn't work. I just removed `version` from the package definition.

**TODO:** Figure out how to get this to work.

## To-do
* Improve Vite config so that `src` can serve as root and, therefore, not
    be necessary in the served URL.
* Set Vite's `base` using dev/prod environment configuration from files
    (see https://stackoverflow.com/a/69041080/356016 and https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html)
* Fix types in `libs/qgiv/qgiv.ts` and remove from tsconfig's `exclude`.
* Replace `spacetime` with something better documented.
* License "[Tin Pan Alley JNL](https://www.fontspring.com/fonts/jeff-levine/tin-pan-alley-jnl)" font or find suitable, free replacement
